# README #

This is the guide for building and running new dashboard.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is the collection of web pages, TypeScript files, JavsScript files, etc. for serving dashboard web site of Manna Farm which is a part of LIFE project.
* v0.1.0-alpha (in progress)
* [Live demo]() (Currently there's no server to run the demo)

### How do I get set up? ###

* Given the source files within a directory, run this command at the command line at the location of that directory:

        npm install
Then all modules and setting files needed should be installed. Without these modules the web pages cannot be rendered properly. Surely this step is needed just once as long as the installed files exist.

    After installation of modules and etc., it can be viewed through Safari and Edge (and Chrome for mobile devices).
